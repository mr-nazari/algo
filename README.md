# Algo Snippets
Are you tired of repetitive algorithmic codes 😢    
Do you want to code faster and work only on the main logic of your program? This is for you 🎁    

## Code Style
Google C++ Style Guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

## Notes
- In some cases, the code style may not match the introduced style. I will try to fix these things gradually.
- Check `definitions.cpp` file it contains aliases and some other stuffs.
- I will try to add most known (or even unknown) algorithms by 2025.

**Enjoy ✨**
