# Algo Snippets
Are you tired of repetitive algorithmic codes 😢    
Do you want to code faster and work only on the main logic of your program? This is for you 🎁    

## Notes
- Check `definitions.cpp` file it contains aliases and some other stuffs 📖
- I will try to add most known algorithms by 2025 📅

## Goal/Plan
Making namespace for each bold topics like graph-theory, number-theory... which includes almost all the algorithms and functionalities        
related to that topic with high quality and super-generalized codes 🔥

*The most important thing is readability at same optimality. Over time, I will try to make the codes better and **cleaner**.*

**Enjoy ✨**
